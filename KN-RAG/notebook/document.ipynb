It is better to come up with something imperfect and get going \\nquickly, rather than overthink this. But this one week timeline does not apply to mature \\napplications. For example, anti-spam is a mature deep learning application. I have seen \\nteams working on already-mature systems spend months to acquire even better dev/test \\nsets.  \\nIf you later realize that your initial dev/test set or metric missed the mark, by all means \\nchange them quickly. For example, if your dev set + metric ranks classifier A above classifier \\nB, but your team thinks that classifier B is actually superior for your product, then this might \\nbe a sign that you need to change your dev/test sets or your evaluation metric.  \\nThere are three main possible causes of the dev set/metric incorrectly rating classifier A \\nhigher:  \\n1. The actual distribution you need to do well on is different from the dev/test sets. \\nSuppose your initial dev/test set had mainly pictures of adult cats. You ship your cat app, \\nand find that users are uploading a lot more kitten images than expected. So, the dev/test set \\ndistribution is not representative of the actual distribution you need to do well on. In this \\ncase, update your dev/test sets to be more representative.  \\n \\nPage 25\\nMachine Learning Yearning-Draft\\nAndrew Ng'),\n",

You have overfit to the dev set. \\nThe process of repeatedly evaluating ideas on the dev set causes your algorithm to gradually \\n“overfit” to the dev set.

If you find that your dev set performance is much better than your test set \\nperformance, it is a sign that you have overfit to the dev set. In this case, get a fresh dev set.  \\nIf you need to track your team’s progress, you can also evaluate your system regularly—say \\nonce per week or once per month—on the test set.

So, you can no longer trust the metric to pick the best \\nalgorithm. It is time to change evaluation metrics. For example, you can change the metric to \\nheavily penalize letting through pornographic images.  I would strongly recommend picking \\na new metric and using the new metric to explicitly define a new goal for the team, rather \\nthan proceeding for too long without a trusted metric and reverting to manually choosing \\namong classifiers.  \\n \\nIt is quite common to change dev/test sets or evaluation metrics during a project.

You train your algorithm using a \\nrandomly chosen subset of 10 examples, then 20 examples, then 30, up to 100, increasing \\nthe number of examples by intervals of ten. You then use these 10 data points to plot your \\nlearning curve. You might find that the curve looks slightly noisy (meaning that the values \\nare higher/lower than expected) at the smaller training set sizes.  \\nWhen training on just 10 randomly chosen examples, you might be unlucky and have a \\nparticularly “bad” training set, such as one with many ambiguous/mislabeled examples. Or, \\nyou might get lucky and get a particularly “good” training set. Having a small training set \\nmeans that the dev and training errors may randomly fluctuate.  \\nIf your machine learning application is heavily skewed toward one class (such as a cat \\nclassification task where the fraction of negative examples is much larger than positive \\nexamples), or if it has a huge number of classes (such as recognizing 100 different animal \\nspecies), then the chance of selecting an especially “unrepresentative” or bad training set is \\nalso larger. For example, if 80% of your examples are negative examples (y=0), and only \\n20% are positive examples (y=1), then there is a chance that a training set of 10 examples \\ncontains only negative examples, thus making it very difficult for the algorithm to learn \\nsomething meaningful.  \\nIf the noise in the training curve makes it hard to see the true trends, here are two solutions:  \\n• Instead of training just one model on 10 examples, instead select several (say 3-10) \\ndifferent randomly chosen training sets of 10 examples by sampling with replacement  \\n10\\nfrom your original set of 100. Train a different model on each of these, and compute the \\ntraining and dev set error of each of the resulting models. Compute and plot the average \\ntraining error and average dev set error.  \\n• If your training set is skewed towards one class, or if it has many classes, choose a \\n“balanced” subset instead of 10 training examples at random out of the set of 100. For \\nexample, you can make sure that 2/10 of the examples are positive examples, and 8/10 are \\n10 Here’s what sampling \\u200bwith replacement\\u200b means: You would randomly pick 10 different examples out of the 100 to form \\nyour first training set. Then to form the second training set, you would again pick 10 examples, but without taking into \\naccount what had been chosen in the first training set. Thus, it is possible for one specific example to appear in both the \\nfirst and second training sets. In contrast, if you were sampling \\u200bwithout replacement\\u200b, the second training set would be \\nchosen from just the 90 examples that had not been chosen the first time around. In practice, sampling with or without \\nreplacement shouldn’t make a huge difference, but the former is common practice.  \\nPage 63\\nMachine Learning Yearning-Draft\\nAndrew Ng'),\n",

More generally, you can make sure the fraction of examples from each class is as \\nclose as possible to the overall fraction in the original training set.  \\nI would not bother with either of these techniques unless you have already tried plotting \\nlearning curves and concluded that the curves are too noisy to see the underlying trends. If \\nyour training set is large—say over 10,000 examples—and your class distribution is not very \\nskewed, you probably won’t need these techniques.  \\nFinally, plotting a learning curve may be computationally expensive: For example, you might \\nhave to train ten models with 1,000, then 2,000, all the way up to 10,000 examples.

Examples \\ninclude image recognition, speech recognition, and email spam classification. Learning \\nalgorithms have also improved so much that we are now surpassing human-level \\nperformance on more and more of these tasks.  \\nFurther, there are several reasons building an ML system is easier if you are trying to do a \\ntask that people can do well:  \\n1. Ease of obtaining data from human labelers.\\u200b For example, since people recognize \\ncat images well, it is straightforward for people to provide high accuracy labels for your \\nlearning algorithm. \\n2. Error analysis can draw on human intuition.\\u200b Suppose a speech recognition \\nalgorithm is doing worse than human-level recognition. Say it incorrectly transcribes an \\naudio clip as “This recipe calls for a \\u200bpear\\u200b of apples,” mistaking “pair” for “pear.” You can \\ndraw on human intuition and try to understand what information a person uses to get the \\ncorrect transcription, and use this knowledge to modify the learning algorithm.  \\n3. Use human-level performance to estimate the optimal error rate and also set \\na “desired error rate.”\\u200b Suppose your algorithm achieves 10% error on a task, but a person \\nachieves 2% error. Then we know that the optimal error rate is 2% or lower and the \\navoidable bias is at least 8%. Thus, you should try bias-reducing techniques.  \\nEven though item #3 might not sound important, I find that having a reasonable and \\nachievable target error rate helps accelerate a team’s progress. Knowing your algorithm has \\nhigh avoidable bias is incredibly valuable and opens up a menu of options to try.  \\nThere are some tasks that even humans aren’t good at. For example, picking a book to \\nrecommend to you; or picking an ad to show a user on a website; or predicting the stock \\nmarket. Computers already surpass the performance of most people on these tasks. With \\nthese applications, we run into the following problems:  \\n•\\nIt is harder to obtain labels.\\u200b For example, it’s hard for human labelers to annotate a \\ndatabase of users with the “optimal” book recommendation. If you operate a website or \\napp that sells books, you can obtain data by showing books to users and seeing what they \\nbuy. If you do not operate such a site, you need to find more creative ways to get data. \\nPage 66\\nMachine Learning Yearning-Draft\\nAndrew Ng'),\n",

This data \\ncomes from the same distribution as a separate dev/test set, and represents the distribution \\nyou care about doing well on. You also have an additional 20,000 images downloaded from \\nthe internet. Should you provide all 20,000+10,000=30,000 images to your learning \\nalgorithm as its training set, or discard the 20,000 internet images for fear of it biasing your \\nlearning algorithm?  \\nWhen using earlier generations of learning algorithms (such as hand-designed computer \\nvision features, followed by a simple linear classifier) there was a real risk that merging both \\ntypes of data would cause you to perform worse. Thus, some engineers will warn you against \\nincluding the 20,000 internet images. \\nBut in the modern era of powerful, flexible learning algorithms—such as large neural \\nnetworks—this risk has greatly diminished. If you can afford to build a neural network with a \\nlarge enough number of hidden units/layers, you can safely add the 20,000 images to your \\ntraining set. Adding the images is more likely to increase your performance.  \\nThis observation relies on the fact that there is some x —> y mapping that works well for \\nboth types of data. In other words, there exists some system that inputs either an internet \\nimage or a mobile app image and reliably predicts the label, even without knowing the \\nsource of the image.  \\nAdding the additional 20,000 images has the following effects: \\n1. It gives your neural network more examples of what cats do/do not look like. This is \\nhelpful, since internet images and user-uploaded mobile app images do share some \\nsimilarities. Your neural network can apply some of the knowledge acquired from internet \\nimages to mobile app images.  \\n2. It forces the neural network to expend some of its capacity to learn about properties that \\nare specific to internet images (such as higher resolution, different distributions of how \\nthe images are framed, etc.) If these properties differ greatly from mobile app images, it \\nwill “use up” some of the representational capacity of the neural network. Thus there is \\nless capacity for recognizing data drawn from the distribution of mobile app images, \\nwhich is what you really care about. Theoretically, this could hurt your algorithms’ \\nperformance.  \\nPage 73\\nMachine Learning Yearning-Draft\\nAndrew Ng'),\n",

Rather \\nthan collecting a lot of data while driving around, there might be an easier way to get this \\ndata: By artificially synthesizing it. \\nSuppose you obtain a large quantity of car/road noise audio clips. You can download this \\ndata from several websites. Suppose you also have a large training set of people speaking in a \\nquiet room. If you take an audio clip of a person speaking and “add” to that to an audio clip \\nof car/road noise, you will obtain an audio clip that sounds as if that person was speaking in \\na noisy car. Using this process, you can “synthesize” huge amounts of data that sound as if it \\nwere collected inside a car.  \\nMore generally, there are several circumstances where artificial data synthesis allows you to \\ncreate a huge dataset that reasonably matches the dev set. Let’s use the cat image detector as \\na second example. You notice that dev set images have much more motion blur because they \\ntend to come from cellphone users who are moving their phone slightly while taking the \\npicture. You can take non-blurry images from the training set of internet images, and add \\nsimulated motion blur to them, thus making them more similar to the dev set.  \\nKeep in mind that artificial data synthesis has its challenges: it is sometimes easier to create \\nsynthetic data that appears realistic to a person than it is to create data that appears realistic \\nto a computer. For example, suppose you have 1,000 hours of speech training data, but only \\n1 hour of car noise. If you repeatedly use the same 1 hour of car noise with different portions \\nfrom the original 1,000 hours of training data, you will end up with a synthetic dataset where \\nthe same car noise is repeated over and over. While a person listening to this audio probably \\nwould not be able to tell—all car noise sounds the same to most of us—it is possible that a \\nlearning algorithm would “overfit” to the 1 hour of car noise. Thus, it could generalize poorly \\nto a new audio clip where the car noise happens to sound different.  \\nAlternatively, suppose you have 1,000 unique hours of car noise, but all of it was taken from \\njust 10 different cars.

It is very expensive to build a 3D car \\nmodel of a car; if you were playing the game, you probably wouldn’t notice that you’re seeing \\nthe same cars over and over, perhaps only painted differently. I.e., this data looks very \\nrealistic to you. But compared to the set of all cars out on roads—and therefore what you’re \\nlikely to see in the dev/test sets—this set of 20 synthesized cars captures only a minuscule \\nfraction of the world’s distribution of cars. Thus if your 100,000 training examples all come \\nfrom these 20 cars, your system will “overfit” to these 20 specific car designs, and it will fail \\nto generalize well to dev/test sets that include other car designs.  \\nWhen synthesizing data, put some thought into whether you’re really synthesizing a \\nrepresentative set of examples. Try to avoid giving the synthesized data properties that \\nmakes it possible for a learning algorithm to distinguish synthesized from non-synthesized \\nexamples—such as if all the synthesized data comes from one of 20 car designs, or all the \\nsynthesized audio comes from only 1 hour of car noise. This advice can be hard to follow.  \\nWhen working on data synthesis, my teams have sometimes taken weeks before we produced \\ndata with details that are close enough to the actual distribution for the synthesized data to \\nhave a significant effect. But if you are able to get the details right, you can suddenly access a \\nfar larger training set than before.  \\n \\n \\nPage 83\\nMachine Learning Yearning-Draft\\nAndrew Ng'),\n",

One example search algorithm is “beam search,” which \\nkeeps only \\u200bK\\u200b top candidates during the search process.
